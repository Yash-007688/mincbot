# Bot Brain System Dependencies
# Core Python packages for the intelligent bot management system

# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library
# The system is designed to work with Python 3.7+ out of the box

# Optional: For enhanced functionality, you can install these packages:
# asyncio-mqtt==0.13.0  # For MQTT communication with Node.js bots
# websockets==11.0.3    # For WebSocket communication
# pydantic==2.5.0       # For enhanced data validation
# fastapi==0.104.1      # For REST API endpoints
# uvicorn==0.24.0       # For running the FastAPI server

# For now, the system works with standard library only
# Run: python bot_brain.py to test the system
