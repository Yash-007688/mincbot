# üëÅÔ∏è Bot Vision Commander - See What Your Bots See!

## üéØ What This System Does

The **Bot Vision Commander** gives you a **real-time view** of what ALL your Minecraft bots can see, plus the ability to give **live commands** to your bot army! It's like having a command center dashboard where you can:

- **See through your bots' eyes** - View what each bot sees in real-time
- **Monitor all bot status** - Health, food, position, inventory, nearby blocks/entities
- **Give live commands** - Type commands and see them executed immediately
- **Track world exploration** - See what resources and areas your bots have discovered
- **Coordinate bot teams** - Manage multiple bots simultaneously

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Terminal Interface (Recommended for testing)
```bash
# Run the terminal-based vision commander
python bot_vision_commander.py
```

### Option 2: Web Dashboard (Best for visual monitoring)
```bash
# Start the web-based dashboard
python bot_vision_web.py
```
Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8080`

## üîç What Each Bot Can See

### Bot Vision Data
Each bot provides real-time information about:

- **Position & Movement**: Current coordinates and where they're looking
- **Nearby Blocks**: All blocks within 16-block view distance
- **Nearby Entities**: Mobs, animals, and other entities nearby
- **Inventory Status**: What items they're carrying
- **Health & Food**: Current survival status
- **Activity State**: What they're currently doing

### World Discovery
The system automatically builds a world map showing:
- **Block Types Found**: stone, dirt, grass, trees, ores, etc.
- **Entity Types Found**: hostile mobs, passive animals, villagers
- **Explored Areas**: Chunks that bots have visited
- **Resource Locations**: Where valuable materials were found

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Bot Vision Collection
- Each bot continuously reports what they see
- System processes and organizes the data
- Real-time updates every 1-2 seconds

### 2. Command Processing
- Your commands are analyzed by the bot brain
- System determines intent and generates actions
- Commands are executed and results tracked

### 3. Live Monitoring
- Dashboard updates automatically
- Bot movements and discoveries shown in real-time
- Health and status changes highlighted

### 4. Data Export
- All vision data can be exported to JSON
- Command history preserved
- World map data saved for analysis

## üì± Interface Options

### Terminal Interface (`bot_vision_commander.py`)
- **Pros**: Lightweight, works anywhere, real-time updates
- **Best for**: Server environments, quick monitoring, automation

### Web Interface (`bot_vision_web.py`)
- **Pros**: Beautiful visuals, mobile-friendly, easy to use
- **Best for**: Desktop monitoring, team collaboration, presentations

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Bot Vision
```python
# In bot_vision_commander.py
self.view_distance = 16        # How far bots can see
self.update_interval = 1.0     # Update frequency in seconds
```

### Adding New Bot Types
```python
# Add new bot capabilities
sample_bots = [
    {
        "name": "Bot4",
        "position": (250, 64, 350),
        "state": "farming",
        "health": 20.0,
        "food": 20.0
    }
]
```

### Custom Commands
```python
# Add new command types in _execute_command method
elif intent == "farming":
    return self._execute_farming_command(entities)
```

## üö® Emergency Features

### Automatic Health Monitoring
- **Low Health Alerts**: Bots automatically flagged when health < 10
- **Food Warnings**: Warnings when food levels are low
- **Critical Status**: Visual indicators for dangerous situations

### Emergency Commands
```
"Bot1, emergency retreat"           # Immediate safety response
"All bots, defensive formation"      # Group protection
"Bot2, heal immediately"            # Priority healing
```

## üìä Data Export & Analysis

### Export Options
```bash
# Export all vision data
python bot_vision_commander.py
# Press 'export' command to save data

# Data includes:
- Bot positions and status
- World map discoveries
- Command history
- Resource locations
```

### JSON Output Format
```json
{
  "bot_visions": {
    "Bot1": {
      "position": [100, 64, 200],
      "nearby_blocks": [...],
      "health": 18.0,
      "state": "mining"
    }
  },
  "world_map": {
    "blocks": {...},
    "entities": {...}
  },
  "command_history": [...]
}
```

## üîå Integration with Your Bot System

### Node.js Bot Connection
The vision system integrates with your existing Node.js bots:
1. **Status Monitoring**: Tracks bot health and position
2. **Command Execution**: Sends commands to your bot system
3. **Data Synchronization**: Keeps vision data current
4. **Task Coordination**: Manages complex bot operations

### Real Bot Integration
To connect with real Minecraft bots:
1. Modify the `_update_bot_vision` method
2. Connect to your bot's data stream
3. Replace sample data with real bot information
4. Add communication protocols (MQTT, WebSocket, etc.)

## üéØ Use Cases

### Resource Management
- **Monitor mining operations** across multiple bots
- **Track resource discovery** in real-time
- **Coordinate resource gathering** efficiently

### Construction Projects
- **Oversee building progress** from command center
- **Coordinate multiple builders** on large projects
- **Monitor material requirements** and supply

### Exploration & Mapping
- **Track exploration progress** across the world
- **Discover new areas** through bot vision
- **Map resource locations** automatically

### Team Coordination
- **Manage bot formations** and movements
- **Coordinate complex operations** between bots
- **Monitor team health** and status

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No bot data showing**: Check if sample bots are initialized
2. **Commands not working**: Ensure bot brain is properly loaded
3. **Web interface not loading**: Check if port 8080 is available
4. **Performance issues**: Reduce update frequency or bot count

### Debug Mode
```python
# Enable detailed logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Check bot vision data
print(commander.get_bot_vision_summary())
```

### Performance Tips
- Reduce `view_distance` for better performance
- Increase `update_interval` for less frequent updates
- Limit the number of bots being monitored
- Use terminal interface for high-performance needs

## üöÄ Advanced Features
